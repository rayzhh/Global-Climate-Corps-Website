    <p><strong>Laura Beck</strong> holds an MPA in Public Affairs, with an emphasis on environmental policy, and a BS in Communications.  After serving as an advocate for her father, who lived with Alzheimer’s disease for 10 years, her career took a surprising turn. Having witnessed the crippling effect of ageism and ableism that elders experience, Laura began a professional journey focused on creating empowered cultures for elders and those who support them.</p>

    <p>For 18 years now, Laura has worked alongside international aging thought leaders, including award winning author and geriatrician, Dr. Bill Thomas, to help drive revolutionary shifts in how we see, engage, and care for elders.  She has also worked in collaboration with other aging specialists on the creation of transformative education designed to drive new paradigms, including how elders and youth can join forces as agents of change.</p>

    <p>Through Climate Sage, Laura is honored and thrilled to merge two primary passions – reinventing the role of elders in our communities and creating empowering ways to reclaim the health of our planet.</p>
