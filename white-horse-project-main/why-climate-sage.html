    <h2>Why Climate SAGE?</h2>
  </div>

<div class="why-climate-sage-content">
  <p class="page-content">Elders recognizing, and being recognized and valued for, their full potential is intimately related to how we recognize and value the life support systems of our planet. While the climate crisis is widely recognized as an existential threat, ageism operates largely under the radar. From a young age, we are collectively bombarded by negative messages about aging, so much so, that older people may internalize a low sense of self-worth or purpose. While the number of aging Americans alone is projected to more than double to over 98 million by 2060, almost a â…“ of older adults say that they have been ignored or not taken seriously due to their age.</p>

  <p class="page-content">A report from the Journal of the American Medical Association found a notable correlation between life purpose and longer life expectancy in a study of 7,000 people over age 50. In response, Climate SAGE works with older individuals, who are impacted by a culture that
  demeans them, and enrolls them in a cause where their knowledge and influence are vitally needed.</p>

  <p class="page-content">Elders are a rich resource waiting to be tapped. By reconnecting with their own full potential, Climate SAGEs develop the capacity to connect with others, and with the planet, in empowering and regenerative ways. Like a pebble meeting water, these ever-widening circles of support spread locally, regionally, and globally.</p>
