# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. **The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.**

**You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own.** These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to remoce or add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    We commit to completing our work in a timely manner and taking responsible for individual tasks as well as giving and receiving constructive criticism.

2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

    We will complete work on time and maintain open communication. We will check in with each other before showing work to the client or turning work in.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    We will communicate over text at least every couple days to update and meet up to do work if necessary.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    Rhea will be the main point person for communication with the clients Nathan and Laura but every group member will always be copied on the email chains. We will email the clients regularly and get their feedback on our design. We will also keep them up-to-date about our user interviews and user testing because they were especially interested in learning more about our audience.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**NO "CODER" OR "DESIGNER" ROLES!**)

    Rhea is the client liaison who will directly communicate with the client.
    Larrisa is the theme leader who will ensure that the design themes are consistent across all pages.
    Talia is the HTMLeader who will make sure that the HTML code between all the pages is consistent.
    Ray is the Captain CSS who will check that our styling/interactivity is consistent with each other.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    We will send the text and call each other if someone is not contributing equally. Since we all want the best for each other, we will be transparent and honest when clearing up issues. One example of what we can say is "Hey ____ we don't think you have been doing your fair share. Could we have a discussion about this?".

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    - We will all share our thoughts and opinions and try to come up with an agreement/ compromise.
    - If we absolutely disagree on something, we will ask for feedback/ an outside opinion.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    We will revisit this contract whenever there is a conflict that needs to be resolved and will edit it if we need to.

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

    We will go to one another's a cappella concerts to establish team bonding (Larrisa and Rhea are both in different a cappella groups). We will also try to meet in person as often as possible because we've gotten along well in our lab section since the start of the semester and want to spend more time together while also working on our project together.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before the instructor will intervene.
